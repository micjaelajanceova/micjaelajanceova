## Hi, I’m Michaela 👋

I’m a Web Development top-up student at EASV in Esbjerg, Denmark, with a background in Multimedia Design.

I focus mainly on web development and care about building applications that are clear, usable, and well structured.  
I like working on projects where things make sense both technically and from a user perspective.
